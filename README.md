# immersitech-engage

This repository contains the latest release of the Immersitech Engage SDK binaries. It is recommended that if are getting started with the SDK you download
one of the tar files for Mac or Windows. Some of the release names have `-full` or `no-spatial-audio` appended. Choose the version which is right for your use case.

If you are looking to get started with our [Public Freeswitch Adapter](https://github.com/Immersitech3D/public_freeswitch_adapter) then you will want to download either the Debian or Ubuntu release files.
